###(ECMAScript) is the official name of the language. 
ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.
ES6	ECMAScript 2015
Since 2016, versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).

### joining multiple words into one variable name
Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Underscore:
first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:
JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

#### JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
